### Who is Lance
Here is Lance Yu. 
During my academic tenure at [SEU](https://www.seu.edu.cn/)/[PKU](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), I pursued a concentrated curriculum in EE while actively participating in numerous software and hardware engineering competitions. My professional foundation and all-round ability were strengthened through successive internships as a Machine Learning Engineer and Business Analyst.
Since joining TikTok's advertising technology division, I have spearheaded algorithmic optimizations for ad delivery systems, specializing in strategic framework development and model enhancements across key recommendation stages: Recall, Rough Ranking, and Fine Ranking. Below are selected projects demonstrating my technical contributions:
- Developed CVR model via federated learning framework integrating prediction capabilities for Trackable/Non-Trackable users
- Deployed multiple retrieval branches leveraging compliant multi-source signals
- Optimized bidding strategies for CostCap products including minROAS, tROAS
- Enhanced advertising models through cross-domain collaboration with recommendation samples
- Participated product launches including internal ads, ad4ad and promotion-to-live products
